# Hierarchical clustering

This app is for hierarchical clustering with dataset 'mtcars'.

## Running the app

The easiest way to run an app is with the `runGitHub()` function from the `"shiny"` package:

```R
# install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)

# Run an app from a subdirectory in the repo
runGitHub("STAT154_Apps", "liyikang1997", subdir = "hclustering")
```
